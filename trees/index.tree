\title{About Me}

\p{I am a final year BTech student in the department of Electrical Engineering. I am interested in theoretical computer science. I took a particular
liking to cryptography. Especially topics in Interactive Proofs and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. I enjoy reading about complexity classes and its intersection with 
cryptography.}

\p{Here are a list of courses that I enjoyed, with resources for each of them. And this is my blog.}

\p{I am currently working on [Verifiable Elections](0001) in the context of Indian elections.}
